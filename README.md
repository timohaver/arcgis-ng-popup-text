#  ArcGIS API for JavaScript Popup Styling in Angular

This repo is a simple application to demonstrate a problem with styling popup text. It was created as a supporting resource for a [support post on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript support forum] (https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-api-for-javascript-questions/styling-popup-text-in-angular/td-p/1130630).

---
## Base Code

This code is adapted from [an ESRI repo with a sample ArcGIS JS API Angular application] (https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/esm-samples/jsapi-angular-cli). 

---

## Get Started

run `npm install`

### Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server that will automatically open a browser window. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
